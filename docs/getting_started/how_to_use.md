title: How to use ?
---

In this section, we are going to focus on the easiest way to use Fable.Form.

We are going to create a login form similar to [this one](/Fable.Form/examples/index.html#login)

:::info
We are assuming that you already have an Elmish application set up with [Bulma](https://bulma.io/)

If needed, you can use [Fulma minimal template](https://fulma.github.io/Fulma/#template) as a starting point

Later, it will be explained how you can customise the view to fit your application style.
:::

<ul class="textual-steps">
<li>

Add **Fable.Form.Simple.Bulma** to your project

```bash
# .NET CLI
dotnet add yourProject.fsproj package Fable.Form.Simple.Bulma

# Paket CLI
paket add Fable.Form.Simple
```

</li>

<li>

Open the library modules

```fsharp
open Fable.Form.Simple
open Fable.Form.Simple.Bulma
```

</li>

<li>

Define a type `Values` which is used to represents the different fields we have in the form.

```fsharp
type Values =
    {
        Email : string
        Password : string
        RememberMe : bool
    }
```

</li>

<li>
Create your model

```fsharp
type Model =
    Form.View.Model<Values>
```

*To keep our example simple, we use a type alias but in a real application you will generaly host it inside a discriminated union or a record*

</li>

<li>

Register 2 messages:

```fsharp
type Msg =
    // Used when a change occure in the form
    | FormChanged of Model
    // Used when the user submit the form
    | LogIn of string * string * bool
```

</li>

<li>

Initialize your `Model`, we set the default value of each fields. Then pass the values to the function `Form.View.idle` which will returns a `Form.View.Model`

```fsharp
let init () =
    {
        Email = ""
        Password = ""
        RememberMe = false
    }
    |> Form.View.idle
    , Cmd.none
```

</li>

<li>

Write the logic of the `update` function.

```fsharp
let update (msg : Msg) (model : Model) =
    match msg with
    // We received a new form model, store it
    | FormChanged newModel ->
        newModel
        , Cmd.none

    // The form has been submitted
    // Here, we have access to the value submitted from the from
    | LogIn (_email, _password, _rememberMe) ->
        // For this example, we just set a message in the Form view
        { model with
            State = Form.View.Success "You have been logged in successfully"
        }
        , Cmd.none
```

</li>

<li>

Create the form logic:

1. First create each field
2. Create an `onSubmit` function which maps the result of the form into a `Msg`
3. Tie the fields and the `onSubmit` function together

```fsharp
let form : Form.Form<Values, Msg> =
    let emailField =
        Form.textField
            {
                Parser =
                    fun value ->
                        if value.Contains("@") then
                            Ok value
                        else
                            Error "The e-mail address must contain a '@' symbol"
                Value =
                    fun values -> values.Email
                Update =
                    fun newValue values ->
                        { values with Email = newValue }
                Error =
                    fun _ -> None
                Attributes =
                    {
                        Label = "Email"
                        Placeholder = "some@email.com"
                    }
            }

    let passwordField =
        Form.passwordField
            {
                Parser = Ok
                Value =
                    fun values -> values.Password
                Update =
                    fun newValue values ->
                        { values with Password = newValue }
                Error =
                    fun _ -> None
                Attributes =
                    {
                        Label = "Password"
                        Placeholder = "Your password"
                    }
            }

    let rememberMe =
        Form.checkboxField
            {
                Parser = Ok
                Value =
                    fun values -> values.RememberMe
                Update =
                    fun newValue values ->
                        { values with RememberMe = newValue }
                Error =
                    fun _ -> None
                Attributes =
                    {
                        Text = "Remember me"
                    }
            }

    let onSubmit =
        fun email password rememberMe ->
            LogIn (email, password, rememberMe)

    Form.succeed onSubmit
        |> Form.append emailField
        |> Form.append passwordField
        |> Form.append rememberMe
```

</li>

<li>

Call `Form.View.asHtml` in the `view` function to render the form

```fsharp
let view (model : Model) (dispatch : Dispatch<Msg>) =
    Form.View.asHtml
        {
            Dispatch = dispatch
            OnChange = FormChanged
            Action = "Sign in"
            Validation = Form.View.ValidateOnSubmit
            CancelPolicy = Form.View.CancelPolicy.DoNothing
        }
        form
        model
```

</li>

</ul>
